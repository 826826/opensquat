What is openSquat
-------------

openSquat is an opensource Intelligence (OSINT) security project to identify **cyber squatting** threats to specific companies or domains, such as:

*   Domain squatting
*   Typo squatting
*   Bitsquatting
*   IDN homograph attacks
*   Phishing campaigns
*   Doppenganger domains
*   Other brand/domain related scams

It does support some key features such as:

*   Automatic newly registered domain updating (once a day)
*   Levenshtein distance to calculate word similarity
*   Fetches active and known phishing domains (Phishing Database project)
*   IDN homograph attack detection
*   Use different levels of confidence threshold to fine tune
*   Save output into different formats (txt, JSON and CSV)
*   Can be integrated with other threat intelligence tools and DNS sinkholes

This is an opensource project so everyone's welcomed to contribute.

Installation
------------

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/atenreiro/opensquat
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have **Python 3.6+** and **pip3** in your environment

Usage Examples
------------

```bash
    # Lazy run with default options
    python main.py

    # for all the options
    python main.py -h

    # With DNS validation (quad9)
    python main.py --dns quad9

    # With Phishing validation (Phishing Database)
    python main.py --phishing phish_results.txt

    # Save output as JSON
    python main.py -o example.json -t json

    # Save output as CSV
    python main.py -o example.csv -t csv

    # Conduct a doppelganger validation (and certificate check)
    python main.py --doppelganger_only yes

    # Search registrations from the last month (default: day)
    python main.py -p month

    # Tweak confidence level. The lower values bring more false positives
    # (0: very high, 1: high (default), 2: medium, 3: low, 4: very low
    python main.py -c 2

    # All validations options
    python main.py --doppelganger_only yes --phishing test.txt --dns quad9

```
